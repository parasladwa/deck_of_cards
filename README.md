(introductory project to learn how to use github)

Creating a simple deck of cards

using a simple class 


iterating through possible cards and creating instances for each
(whilst checking if card has a face value - if so, use dictionary)

shuffling cards using random.choice(deck) and forloop until shuffled deck has length of 52

this will be used for further projects, blackjack and poker
